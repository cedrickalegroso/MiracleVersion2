Notes
This script is dealing with some unusual things... Namely, the player and AI entrance into the ring.
Avoid doing stupid stuff while the animations are playing, don't try and enter the ring at the same time as another player, so on so forth, and you should be good.
If, for some reason, you decide to try and attack a nearby player while you're doing a ring entrance (or something equally dumb), try not to hold us responsible for the outcome.
